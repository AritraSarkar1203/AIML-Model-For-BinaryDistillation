**🏭 Distillation Column AI/ML Project**

This project focuses on building an Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning (AI/ML) model to simulate and predict the behavior of a distillation column.
The model is trained using experimental/simulated Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) or distillation data and tested for its prediction capability.
